## Firebase Integration

If you are contributing Firebase-related changes, ensure that credentials are handled securely. Follow these steps:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store Firebase credentials in environment variables or a `.env` file (e.g., for Node.js or Next.js projects).  
     Example `.env` file:  
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
     ```

2. **Using Credentials in Code**:
   - Access credentials using environment variables instead of hardcoding them.  
     Example:  
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
       authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
       projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
       storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
       messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
       appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
     };
     ```

3. **Restrict API Key Access**:
   - In the Firebase Console, restrict the API key to authorized domains or IP addresses.

4. **Avoid Committing Sensitive Files**:
   - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it isnâ€™t pushed to GitHub:  
     ```plaintext
     # Environment variables
     .env
     ```
